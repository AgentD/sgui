\section event The event system internals

The file \ref sgui_event.h contains the declaration of the \ref sgui_event
data structure wich encapsulates every possible kind of event by specifying
event \b source (window and widget), event \b type (integer ID) and
an optional argument supplied by the source.

The integer IDs specifying different event types are also declared in the same
file (including widget events).

Through the functions \ref sgui_event_connect and \ref sgui_event_disconnect
it is possible to create signals-and-slots like event-action connections. The
connections are internally stored in a linked list. The \ref sgui_event_post
function is used by widgets, canvases and the windows to post events to a
global queue.

The backend implementations use functions declared in \ref sgui_internal.h
to control the event queue:
 - \ref sgui_internal_reset_events is used to reset the entire event system
   to an initial state. It is used by both \ref sgui_init and \ref sgui_deinit
   to initialize and cleanup the event system.
 - \ref sgui_internal_process_events is called by the main loop functions
   \ref sgui_mail_loop and \ref sgui_main_loop_step to fetch all events from
   the queue, look up matching connections from the list and call the
   registered callbacks.
