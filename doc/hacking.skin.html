<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>The skinning system</h3>

The SGUI widget implementations use functions declared in <b>sgui_skin.h</b>
to actually draw the widgets or to get outlines of a typical widget type in
order to determine their own geometry in the constructor. The functions
(implemented in <b>skin.c</b>) internally redirect the calls to callbacks from
the currently set <b>sgui_skin</b> structure, declared in
<b>sgui_internal.h</b>. The gui skin is actually a set of hard coded functions
that use the canvas drawing functions.<br>
<br>
The default skin is implemented in <b>skin_default.c</b> and exposed as a
global variable.<br>
<br>
A new skin can be implemented fairly easily by simply implementing the skin
structure callbacks. One could theoretically also extend the skin structure,
and add a lua state object, so skin callbacks could be redirected to
Lua code, dynamically loaded and compiled at runtime.<br>
<br>
In order to set a certain skin implementation, the function
<b>sgui_skin_set</b> is used. If given a <b>NULL</b> argument, it resets the
skin to default.<br>
<br>
Changing skins while widgets are still existing is generally bad, as widgets
use skin information in their constructor to compute their outlines.
