<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>The canvas data structure</h3>

Every window object has an instance of an <b>sgui_canvas</b> implementation.
The canvas offers rendering functions with legacy-OpenGL&reg; style begin-end
functions.<br>
<br>
Widgets can be added to a canvas. The canvas keeps track of the widgets,
receives events from the window that it redirects to the apropriate widgets,
keeping track of focused widgets, etc...<br>
<br>
The canvas can also accumulate <i>dirty rects</i> from widgets that request
redrawing. When asking the canvas to render widgets, it makes sure child
widgets are rendered with their apropriate offsets and clipped in respect to
their parents.<br>
<br>
This is all done by the interface functions in <b>canvas.c</b>. All an
implementation of a canvas has to do is supplying the callbacks for
<i>drawing</i>, which means:
<ul>
<li>begin/end callbacks (optional)
<li>clearing
<li>drawing boxes
<li>creating an instance of a pixmap implementation
<li>blitting/blending pixmaps
<li>drawing a one line text string with a specified font and color
</ul>
Clipping and offseting is taken care of by the interface functions, so the
callbacks always get sane input with absolute coordinates, clipped to the
size of the surface.<br>
<br>
When creating a canvas instance, <b>sgui_canvas_init</b> has to be
used at first to initialize the super structure.<br>
<br>
A canvas implementation will also have to be able to create instances of the
asociated <b>sgui_pixmap</b> implementation. A reference implementation that
copies the pixel data to an internal buffer can be created using
<b>sgui_internal_mem_pixmap_create</b>.<br>
<br>
When creating a new canvas implementation it is adviseable to take a look at
the header files and other existing canvas implementations for details.
