<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>The event system internals</h3>

The file <b>sgui_event.h</b> contains the declaration of the <b>sgui_event</b>
data structure wich encapsulates every possible kind of event by specifying
event <b>source</b> (window and widget), event <b>type</b> (integer ID) and
an optional argument supplied by the source.<br>
<br>
The integer IDs specifying different event types are also declared in the same
file (including widget events).<br>
<br>
Through the functions <b>sgui_event_connect</b> and
<b>sgui_event_disconnect</b> it is possible to create signals-and-slots like
event-action connections. The connections are internally stored in a linked
list. The <b>sgui_event_post</b> function is used by widgets, canvases and
the windows to post events to a global queue.<br>
<br>
The backend implementations use functions declared in <b>sgui_internal.h</b>
to control the event queue:
<ul>
<li><b>sgui_internal_reset_events</b> is used to reset the entire event system
    to an initial state. It is used by both <b>sgui_init</b> and
    <b>sgui_deinit</b> to initialize and cleanup the event system.
<li><b>sgui_internal_process_events</b> is called by the main loop functions
    <b>sgui_mail_loop</b> and <b>sgui_main_loop_step</b> to fetch all
    events from the queue, look up matching connections from the list and
    call the registered callbacks.
</ul>
