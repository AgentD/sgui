<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>The widget data structure</h3>

A widget has an area that it occupies (parent relative), pointers to the
parent widget and to the first child widget. Children are stored in a linked
list, as there can be a variable numer of children, thus there is also a
pointer to the next child on the current level.<br>
<br>
Other than that, a widget has a pointer to the canvas that it is currently
attached to, a flag field on how the widget handles keyboard focus and a
visibillity flag (non-zero if the widget should be drawn, zero if not).<br>
<br>
The widget structure has four interesting callback functions:
<ul>
<li>A <b>destroy</b> callback holding a pointer to the destructor function
<li>A <b>draw</b> callback that is used for rendering the widget
<li>An <b>event</b> callback that is used to send an event to the widget
<li>A <b>state change</b> callback that is called, when the widget visibillity
    or position changes, or when children get attached/removed, when the
    parent changes or when the canvas attachment changes.
</ul>
The child-parent tree handling, event propagation, etc is already implemented
by the basic interface functions. To initialize the super structure, a derived
data type can use the <b>sgui_widget_init</b> function.<br>
<br>
What a dervied widget has to do at minimum is to implement the beforementioned
callbacks. Please note that in the <b>draw callback</b>, widgets normaly don't
use the canvas drawing functions directly, but instead use the functions of
the skinning subsystem.<br>
<br>
The flag field of the widget can contain the following flags:
<ul>
<li><b>SGUI_FOCUS_ACCEPT</b> The widget accepts keyboard focus.
<li><b>SGUI_FOCUS_DRAW</b> The canvas is allowed to draw a border around
    the widgets bounding box to indicate keyboard focus.
<li><b>SGUI_FOCUS_DROP_ESC</b> When the escape key is pressed, the canvas is
    allowed to remove keyboard focus from the widget.
<li><b>SGUI_FOCUS_DROP_TAB</b> When the tab key is pressed, the canvas is
    allowd to move focus to the next widget in focus order, which is
    determined using <b>sgui_widget_find_next_focus</b>
<li><b>SGUI_WIDGET_VISIBLE</b> This flag is set when the widget is visible.
</ul>
The focus order that the <b>sgui_widget_find_next_focus</b> function dictates
depends on the order in which widgets are attached to their parent widget.
The function tries to find a visible child widget which accepts focus. If it
can't find any, it it moves on to the next widget on the current level of the
hirarchy and repeates the process. If this is still unsuccessful, it goes to
the next neightbour widget of the parent and repeates the entire process. If
it reaches the root window without finding a widget that acceps focus, it
gives up, in which case the canvas gives it another try by calling the
function on the root window in order to find the first widget in the focus
order.

An <b>example implementation</b> of a small custum widget is given in the
directory <b>extras/widget.c</b>.
