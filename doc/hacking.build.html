<h1>SGUI</h1>

<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>The SGUI build system</h3>

The sgui library uses a CMake based build system. CMake is a cross platform
tool to generate platform dependend files for compiling source code (e.g. it
can generate a Makefile or an MSVC solution file).<br>
For more information on CMake, please consult
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">the CMake website</a>.<br>
<br>
Since the demo programs need special files and the Windows&reg; backend needs
the freetype DLL, the build tree stub is contained within the source tree.<br>
<br>
<h4>Compiling on Unix-like systems</h4>

To compile and build everything, issue the following commands from within the
source directory:
<p class="code">
<font class="command">cd</font> build<br>
<font class="command">cmake</font> ..<br>
<font class="command">make</font><br>
</p>
If you replace "cmake" in the above commands with "ccmake", you will get a
text based user interface. Pressing [c] will configure the build system and
give you a screen with lots of compilation options. Pressing [c] again and
then [g] generates the build system and you will return to the shell where
you can run make to compile sgui.<br>
<br>
SGUI can easily be cross compiled using a special CMake cross-compilation
toolchain file. Toolchain files for 32 bit and 64 bit Windows&reg; via Mingw
are provided with the source tree. Simply replace the above commands with the
following to cross compile for 32 bit Windows&reg;:
<p class="code">
<font class="command">cd</font> build<br>
<font class="command">cmake</font> .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../CMake/mingw.cmake"<br>
<font class="command">make</font><br>
</p>
Alternatively, use "mingw64.cmake" for a 64 bit Windows&reg; build.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>:<pre>
   Since mingw cross compiling has so far only been done on Arch
   Linux, it might require minor adjustments of the mingwXX.cmake file to
   point to the correct compiler location.

   Cross compiling for other architectures will require some fiddling with
   CMake toolchain files, if not even porting of SGUI itself. <i>If something
   breaks that should not break, please let me know.</i></pre>
<br>
<h4>Compiling on Windows&reg;</h4>
<img src="images/cmake.png"><br>
<br>
On Windows&reg;, start the CMake gui program. A screenshot of the CMake GUI
can be seen above.<br>
<br>
There should be a field labeled "Where is the source code" <b>(1)</b>. Enter
the path where this README file is located.<br>
<br>
In an other field, labeled "Where to build the binaries" <b>(2)</b>, enter the
path to the "build" directory within the directory where this README file is
located.<br>
<br>
When clicking configure <b>(3)</b>, a dialog should pop open where the target
build system can be selected (e.g. which version of MSVC to use) and the main
dialog should be filled with lots of configuration options that you can see
above (initially displayed in red). Pressing "configure" <b>(3)</b> again and
then "generate" <b>(4)</b> should generate the build system (e.g. An MSVC
Solution file) which can then be used to compile sgui.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>:<pre>
   Some effort has been put into making SGUI compile with VisualStudio&reg;,
   on Windows&reg;, however it is not a priority target. It should work in
   general, but it is only tested occasionally.

   It has been observed that sometimes CMake generates an error message, but
   no error actually occoured and re-running "configure" and "generate"
   created a working build system.

   Depending on your versions of Windows&reg; and VisualStudio&reg;, you may
   want do disable Direct3D&reg; 11 in the compile configuration.
</pre>
<br>

<h4>Compilation options</h4>

When running cmake the following build options are available:
<ul>
<li><b>COLDIALOG</b> Compile with color selection dialog. <b>Default: ON</b>
<li><b>COLPICKER</b> Compile with color picker widget. <b>Default: ON</b>
<li><b>MEMCANVAS</b> Enable or disable the memory canvas implementation.
    <b>Default: ON</b>. This option might not be disabled if the backend
    implementation for the current platform needs the memory canvas. If this
    is set to OFF, the definition <b>SGUI_NO_MEM_CANVAS</b> is set via the
    preprocessor.
<li><b>MVC</b> Compile with model object for MVC widgets. <b>Default: ON</b>
<li><b>OPENGL</b> Enable or disable OpenGL&reg; support. <b>Default: ON</b>
    If this is set to OFF, the definition <b>SGUI_NO_OPENGL</b> is set via the
    preprocessor.
<li><b>NOFLOAT</b> Can be used to disable all internal use of floating point
    data types and arithmetic. <b>Default: OFF</b>. If this is set to ON, the
    definition <b>SGUI_NO_FLOAT</b> is set via the preprocessor.
<li><b>FRAME</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the frame widget is not compiled.
<li><b>GROUP</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the group widget is not compiled.
<li><b>ICONCACHE</b> Default ON. If set to OFF,
    the icon cache is not compiled.
<li><b>ICONVIEW</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the icon view widget is not
    compiled.
<li><b>MESSAGEBOX</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the message box is not
    compiled.
<li><b>NATIVE_MB</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the native message box is
    not compiled.
<li><b>SUBVIEW</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the sub view widget is
    not compiled.
<li><b>TABS</b> Default ON. If set to OFF, the tab widget is not compiled.
<li><b>NOPS</b> For all the above functionallity, noop functions that always
    fail are generated if they are disabled to avoid linking problems.
    If set to OFF, there will be no noop implementations. Default ON.
<li><b>DIRECT3D9</b> Compile with Direct3D&reg; 9 support. <b>Default: ON</b>
    If set to OFF, <b>SGUI_NO_D3D9</b> is defined via the pre processor.
<li><b>DIRECT3D11</b> Compile with Direct3D&reg; 11 support. <b>Default: ON</b>
    If set to OFF, <b>SGUI_NO_D3D11</b> is defined via the pre processor.
</ul>

Some options may or may not be available, depending on whether the target
system supports them in the first place, or wether the target system needs
them and cannot have them disabled.<br>
<br>
Also note that some options might be interdependend, e.g. the color dialog
uses the color picker widget, so when disabling the widget, the dialog will
also not be available.<br>
<br>
Depending on the target operating system, the following definitions are set
via the preprocessor:
<ul>
<li>SGUI_WINDOWS
<li>SGUI_UNIX
</ul>

<h3>Generating Doxygen reference</h3>

If Doxygen is available on a system, running the target <b>doxydoc</b>
processes the <i>Doxyfile.in</i> file to generate a propper Doxygen input file
and runs Doxygen on the input file.<br>
<br>
The Doxygen output is written to the directory <i>doxydoc</i> in the output
directory tree.

<h3>Installing &amp; generating binary packages</h3>

On Unix&reg; like systems, <b>make install</b> can be used to install the SGUI
library. By default, headers are installed to <i>/usr/local/include</i> and
the compiled, stripped library to <i>/usr/local/lib</i>.<br>
<br>
To change the prefix from <i>/usr/local</i> to something differnt, the
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX has to be altered.<br>
<br>
To install to a different root directory,
<b>make DESTDIR=&lt;root&gt;install</b> can be used to install to
<i>&lt;root&gt;/&lt;prefix&gt;/lib</i> and
<i>&lt;root&gt;/&lt;prefix&gt;/include</i> instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
When cross compiling for Windows&reg;, the target <b>pack</b>
(i.e. <b>make pack</b>) can be used to generate a zip archive with
Windows&reg; binaries, example programs, documentation, etc... like the one
that can be downloaded from the SGUI website.

<h3>The source directory tree</h3>

The library is split into several modules, each in a dedicated subdirectory,
that are then compiled into a single library:
<ul>
<li><b>core</b> The library core. Contains basic widget data structure, widget
    handling, window system abstraction, font rendering, helper data
    structures, etc.
<li><b>widgets</b> The GUI widgets. Contains only the implementations of the
    individual widgets.
<li><b>dialogs</b> The GUI dialog windows. Contains only the implementations
    of the individual dialog windows.
</ul>
Each of those modules contains an <b>include/</b> directory with headers,
a <b>src/</b> directory with source files and a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>.<br>
<br>
Other than that, there are few more sub directories:
<ul>
<li><b>build</b> The output directory, see below.
<li><b>CMake</b> Contains CMake files (e.g. mingw cross toolchain config)
<li><b>doc</b> The hand written HTML documation you are reading right now
<li><b>extras</b> Contains example and demo programms
<li><b>tests</b> Contains unit tests
</ul>

In addition, the source directory contains a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>, a doxygen
<b>Doxyfile</b> the textfiles <b>LICENSE</b> and <b>README</b> as well as the
beforementioned <b>package.sh</b>.
<br>
<br>
The combined <b>include</b> directories, the <b>doc</b> directory, the
<b>extras</b> directory and the generated doxygen documentation end up in the
development package.<br>
<br>
Everything inside the source tree ends up in the source package.<br>
<br>
The <b>LICENSE</b> and <b>README</b> files are added to every package.

<h3>The output directory tree</h3>

The output directory initially contains the following entries:
<ul>
<li><b>font</b> This directory contains the TTF font file required by the
    example and demo programs.
<li><b>win_dep</b> This directory contains additional dependencies for
    the Windows&reg; build (currently only FreeType binaries and headers).
<li><b>runvalgrind.sh</b> This script runs valgrind on a sample program using
    the given valgrind supression file.
<li><b>valgrind.supp</b> A valgrind supression file that's supposed to hide
    reported memory leeks inside the X11 XIM functions, and Mesa3D.
</ul>
<br>
When building SGUI, a lot of temporary clutter is generated by CMake and make.
The interesting directores are <b>bin</b> and <b>lib</b>, the former
containing executables and dynamic libraries and the later containing static
libraries.
