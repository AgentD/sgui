<h2>Using the SGUI library</h2>

<h3>Creating and using windows</h3>

Windows in SGUI are represented by the
<a href="../doxydoc/html/sgui__window_8h.html"><b>sgui_window</b></a>
structure. To create
a window, simply call the <b>sgui_window_create</b> function which takes
three parameters:

<p class="code">
sgui_window* sgui_window_create( <font class="keyword">sgui_window*</font> parent,
                                 <font class="keyword">unsigned int</font> width,
                                 <font class="keyword">unsigned int</font> height,
                                 <font class="keyword">int</font> resizeable );
</p>

<ul>
<li>The first parameter specifies the parent window. <b>NULL</b> means to
    create the window on the root/desktop window, a pointer to an existing
    window makes the new window to a child window of the existing one.
    Child windows are only visible inside their parent and are not managed by
    the systems window manager.
<li>The next two parameters, <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>, specify the
    size of the windows drawing area in pixels (i.e. the area inside the
    window, not taking the window borders into account).
<li>The next paramter, <b>resizeable</b> specifies whether the user should be
    able to resize the window with the mouse or not.
<li>The constants <b>SGUI_FIXED_SIZE</b> and <b>SGUI_RESIZEABLE</b> are
    provided so you don't have to pass the magic values <b>0</b> and
    <b>1 (nonzero)</b> to the function.
</ul>

The functions returns a <b>pointer to an sgui_window struct</b> on success, or
<b>NULL</b> on error. All functions operating on a window take that pointer as
a first parameter and are named <b>sgui_window_*</b>.<br>
<br>
If the function succeeds and a window is created, the window is initially
invisible. To make it visible and allow the user to interact with it, the
following function is used:

<p class="code">
<font class="keyword">void</font> sgui_window_set_visible( sgui_window* wnd, <font class="keyword">int</font> visible );
</p>

As you can see, the function name starts with the name of the data structure
it works on and takes a pointer to it as a first parameter.
The <b>sgui_window_set_visible</b> function takes an argument, indicating
whether the window should be visible or not. Again, there are constants
(<b>SGUI_INVISIBLE</b> and <b>SGUI_VISIBLE</b>) to avoid magic values.<br>
<br>
Once you are done using your window, you should destroy it (i.e. free its
resources to avoid leaks). The following function is used for doing so:
<p class="code">
<font class="keyword">void</font> sgui_window_destroy( sgui_window* wnd );
</p>
The naming scheme of SGUI functions should be pretty straight forward:
<ul>
<li>Functions operating on objects start with the name of the object and take
    a pointer to it as their first argument.<br>
    E.g. functions operating on <b>sgui_window</b> are named
    <b>sgui_window_*</b> and take a <b>sgui_window pointer</b> as first
    argument.</li>
<li>Functions for creating SGUI objects are always named <b>create</b>.<br>
    E.g. the function for creating an <b>sgui_window</b> is named
    <b>sgui_window_create</b>.

<li>Functions for freeing SGUI objects are always named <b>destroy</b>.<br>
    E.g. the function for destroying an <b>sgui_window</b> is named
    <b>sgui_window_destroy</b>.
</ul>
With this in mind, it should be easy to understand what SGUI functions do from
reading their name. So lets take a look at a simple example that uses some
window functions:<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
<font class="cpp">#include</font> <font class="string">"sgui.h"</font><br>
<br>
<font class="keyword">int</font> main( )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window* wnd;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_init( );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wnd = sgui_window_create( <font class="keyword">NULL</font>, <font class="number">400</font>, <font class="number">300</font>, SGUI_RESIZEABLE );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_set_title( wnd, <font class="string">"Simple Sample"</font> );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_move_center( wnd );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_set_visible( wnd, SGUI_VISIBLE );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_main_loop( );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_destroy( wnd );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_deinit( );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="keyword">return</font> <font class="number">0</font>;<br>
}
</p>

If you compile the program (with command line presented previously, or your
favourite IDE) and run it, you will see a blank, 400*300 pixel window in the
center of your screen (assuming your window manager didn't resize it) and the
title bar of the window will say "Simple Sample".<br>
The final result should look something like this:<br>
<img src="images/sample1.png"><br>
<br>
The title bar of the window is set by calling <b>sgui_window_set_title</b> and
the window is moved to the center of the screen by calling
<b>sgui_window_move_center</b>.<br>
<br>
You will notice that you can maximze the window or randomly resize it (if your
window manager allows that). This is because the window has been created with
the <b>SGUI_RESIZEABLE</b> argument. If we had used <b>SGUI_FIXED_SIZE</b> you
would not be able to resize or maximize the window.<br>
<br>
Also note, that the <b>destroy</b> is called after the main loop, but before
the <b>deinit</b> function. It is <b>a requirement</b> that the
<b>sgui_deinit</b> function is the <b>last SGUI function you call</b> and
likewise <b>sgui_init</b> the first SGUI function you call.<br>
<br>
In this example, the <b>sgui_main_loop</b> function does not return until the
user closes the window. When that happens, the function returns, the window
gets destroyed (pressing the close button only makes it invisible) and the
program exits.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, it should be easy to play around with various window
functions (just take a look at the <b>"sgui_window.h"</b> header or at the
doxygen documentation).
