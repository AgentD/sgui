<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

This chapter is intended to provide an overview and details of the
architecture and internal workings of SGUI for people who intend to make
changes or additions to SGUI.

<h3>Architectural overview</h3>

<img src="images/classes.svg" width="500">
<br>
<br>
The architecture of SGUI is rather simple. The above image gives a rough
outline of the class hirarchy (yes, you read right, <i>class</i> hirarchy).
<br>
<ul>
<li>Various widgets are derived from a common base class, the
    <b>sgui_widget</b>.
<li>The <b>sgui_window</b> is actually a base class, derived by an
    implementation for your platform and also other implementations like an
    OpenGL&reg; back end.<br>The xlib window is only drawn as an example.
<li>The window class only handles a window, it does not touch any widgets or
    do any rendering.
<li>Widget management is done by using a common <b>sgui_widget_manager</b>
    class of which the window has an instance.
<li>Rendering is done by providing a pointer to an <b>sgui_canvas</b>.
<li>The <b>sgui_canvas</b> is a base class that provides rendering functions
    for drawing to a fixed size surface.
<li>There are various canvas implementations (derived classes). The window
    implementation must make sure to create an apropriate implementation.
    <br>The xlib canvas is only drawn as an example.
<li>Of course there are other classes, but those are only isolated, minor
    helper data structures.
</ul>
<br>
This is pretty much what happens inside the SGUI main loop:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The platforms main loop implementation receives messages from the window
    system and redirects them to the appropriate windows.
<li>The windows responds to the messages, translate them to SGUI events and
    redirect them to their widget managers.
<li>The widget managers process the events and redirect them to the
    appropriate widgets.
<li>The widgets process their events and do something.
<li>Some widgets decide that they need to be redrawn and tell it to their
    responsible widget managers.
<li>The windows checks their widget managers whether there are widgets to be
    redrawn.
<li>If there are widgets to be redrawn, the coresponding widget manager is
    given a pointer to a canvas implementation used by the window.
<li>The widget manager initiates drawing and gives the pointer to the widgets
    that need rerendering.
<li>The widgets use skinning functions to draw themselves.
<li>The windows present their canvases to the user.
</ul>
