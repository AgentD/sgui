<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

This chapter is intended to provide an overview and details of the
architecture and internal workings of SGUI for people who intend to make
changes or additions to SGUI.

<h3 id="arch">Architectural overview</h3>

The SGUI library is split into a <b>core</b> module (the directory 'core' in
the source tree) and the <b>widget</b> code (the directory 'widgets') and the
<b>dialog</b> window code (the directory 'dialogs').<br>
<br>
The core module contains all basic data structures and the platform dependend
implementations. It consists basically of the following subsystems:
<ul>
<li>The <b>initialization and mainloop</b> functions are declared inside
    <b>sgui.h</b>. They are directly implemented in the backend, usually in a
    file called 'platform.c' in the backend source directory.
<li>The <b>event management</b> subsystem takes care of an event queue
    and the event-action-connections. The declarations are in
    <b>sgui_event.h</b> and the implementation in <b>event.c</b> in the source
    directory. The keyboard codes are defined in <b>sgui_keycodes.h</b>.
<li><b>Helper data structures</b>: There is a data structure for handling
    rectangles. Declarations are in <b>sgui_rect.h</b> and implementation in
    <b>rect.c</b>. There are UTF8 string handling functions declared in
    <b>sgui_utf8.h</b> and implemented in <b>utf8.c</b>.
<li><b>Filesystem abstraction</b> is provided by <b>sgui_filesystem.h</b>
    with a reference implementation in <b>filesystem.c</b>.
<li>A <b>window abstraction</b> data type. <b>sgui_window_create_desc</b> is
    the only function directly implemented by the backend.
<li>A <b>rendering context</b> data type for abstraction of hardware
    accelerated rendering context. The creation function is implemented
    directly in the backend.
<li>An <b>abstract widget data type</b>.
<li><b>Rendering</b> is done by the <b>sgui_canvas</b> data structure.
    Each window has a canvas that widgets can be attached to. The backend code
    can implement its own canvas type, or use a reference implementation in
    <b>mem_canvas.c</b> that renders to an offscreen memory buffer. A canvas
    can also create <b>sgui_pixmap</b> instances that can blit or blend image
    date onto a canvas.
<li><b>Font rendering abstraction</b> is handled by the <b>sgui_font</b>
    structure, implementation directly in the backend.
<li><b>Glyph caching</b> is provided by the <b>sgui_font_cache</b> data
    structure. A backend may or may not use this data structure to cache
    glyphs. The implementation uses an RB-Tree of rects to pre-rendered and
    organize glyphs on a pixmap.
<li>An <b>icon cache</b> is provided by <b>sgui_icon_cache</b>. It also
    provides an integer ID to rect on a pixmap lookup using an RB-tree.
<li>Actually rendering a widget onto a canvas is done by the <b>skinning</b>
    subsystem, using in implementation of an <b>sgui_skin</b> structure.
    There is a default implementation in <b>skin_default.c</b>, exported via
    <b>sgui_internal.h</b>. The gui skin is hard coded. Somebody who is
    sufficiently bored might, for instance, implement a loadable skin by
    loading a Lua file and calling into that for drawing widgets.
</ul>

<h3 id="code">Coding style</h3>

As long as there is no indent file, here are a few guidelines:
<ul>
<li><b>Braces</b> are always on the <b>next line</b> with the same indentation
    as the asociated control statement.
<li>Lines aren't longer than <b>80 characters</b>.
<li><b>Space characters (4 of them)</b> are used for indentation.
<li>There is no space between a function name and the opening paranthesis.
<li>There is no space between a control keyword and the opening paranthesis.
<li>There is no space between a closing paranthesis and a semicolon.
<li>There is a space between the first and last function argument and the
    asociated parantheses, unless line space needs to be conserved
<li>When wrapping a function call or declaration, the first argument in the
    next line is indented to the same column as the first argument.
<li>When wrapping expressions, the operator is always at the end of the line,
    never at the beginning of the new line.
<li>All <b>structures are typedefed</b>.
<li><b>No typedefs to atomic data types</b> are used. Always use the integer
    data types provided by C (i.e. unsigned int and int).
<li>Preprocessor definitions are used instead of enums.
<li>Try <b>not</b> to <b>use</b> any <b>floating point</b> calculations
    at all.
<li><b>Functions or structures</b> delcared in publicly visible headers have
    to start with <b>sgui_* prefix</b>.
<li><b>Constants</b> have to start with <b>SGUI_*</b>
<li>Use <b>C++ guards</b> around publicly visible function declarations.
<li>Functions not declared in any headers have to be static.
<li>Publicly accessable <b>headers</b> have to start with <b>sgui_*</b>
<li>For every <b>structure or union</b>, there is a forward declaration in
    <b>sgui_predef.h</b>
<li><b>Every new header</b> has to be included by <b>sgui.h</b>
</ul>
