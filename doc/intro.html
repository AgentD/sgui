<h1>SGUI</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<br>

SGUI is a small, simple, cross platform GUI library, written in plain
ANSI C (C89), with the aim to create a simple, easy to use "just-works" GUI
library for small applications and test programs that just need a simple GUI.
<br>
Major design goals are simplicity, small code size and correctness (concerning
the standards involved and memory leaks).<br>
<br>
Above you can see screenshots of the SGUI test program.<br>
<br>
The idea of creating a small GUI library emerged after being unsatisfied with
the existing GUI libraries that tend to be extremely bloated, resource hungry,
complicated and very slow on older systems.<br>
<br>
Note however, that as planed as this may sound, the entire library in its
current shape emerged from plain boredomness in school. It started out as an
XLib play pen that progressively evolved into its current shape. There was no
planning and its design may change in the future.

<h3>Supported platforms</h3>

So far, SGUI has a Windows&reg; and an Xlib back end. Because there are no
users and developers besides me, I tested it on every system available to me
and "documented" both the systems and the results:

<br>
The Raspberry Pi test was conducted by compiling and running the normal Xlib
port on the Pi. There is no specialized OpenVG&reg; framebuffer backend for
the Raspberry Pi (yet). The windows were created propperly but they had a
strange greenish background color and the widgets weren't visible at all, but
the test is already months ago and a lot has changed in the code since then
(the Xlib port used XImages back than, now it uses the XRender extension), so
I flaged it as "Untested".

<h3>People involved</h3>

Currently, I, David Oberhollenzer, do everything around here. Suggestions for improvements, forks, pull requests, bug reports or other help are very welcome.
