<h1>SGUI</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

SGUI is a small, simple, cross platform GUI library, written in plain
ANSI C (C89), with the aim to create a simple, easy to use "just-works" GUI
library for small applications and test programs that just need a simple GUI.
<br>
Major design goals are simplicity, small code size and correctness (concerning
the standards involved and memory leaks).<br>
<br>
Above you can see screenshots of the SGUI test program.<br>
<br>
The idea of creating a small GUI library emerged after being unsatisfied with
the existing GUI libraries that tend to be extremely bloated, resource hungry,
complicated and very slow on older systems.<br>
<br>
Note however, that as planed as this may sound, the entire library in its
current shape emerged from plain boredomness in school. It started out as an
XLib play pen that progressively evolved into its current shape. There was no
planning and its design may change in the future.

<h3>Supported platforms</h3>

So far, SGUI has a Windows&reg; and an Xlib back end. It has been confirmed to
work on the following platforms:
