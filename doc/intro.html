<h1>SGUI</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

SGUI is a small, simple, cross platform GUI library, written in plain
ANSI C (C89), with the aim to create a simple, easy to use "just-works" GUI
library for small applications and test programs that just need a simple GUI.
<br>
Major design goals are simplicity, small code size and correctness (concerning
the standards involved and memory leaks).<br>
<br>
Above you can see screenshots of the SGUI test program.<br>
<br>
The idea of creating a small GUI library emerged after being unsatisfied with
the existing GUI libraries that tend to be extremely bloated, resource hungry,
complicated and very slow on older systems.<br>
<br>
The project originally emerged from an Xlib play pen written out of plain
boredomness in school.

<h3>Supported platforms</h3>

So far, SGUI has a Windows&reg; and an Xlib back end. The demo application has
been successfully compiled and run under Wine, Windows&reg; 98, XP, 7 (32bit
and 64 bit), Ubuntu 32 bit, Arch 64 bit, CentOS 6 32 bit and 64 bit.<br>
<br>
The OpenGL&reg; support of the library has been successfully used with
variuous ATI and nVidia cards (proprietary implementation) as well an
integrated Intel GPU (via Mesa and proprietary implementation).

<h3>People involved</h3>

Currently, I, David Oberhollenzer, do everything around here. Suggestions for
improvements, forks, pull requests, bug reports or other help are very
welcome.
