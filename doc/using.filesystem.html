<h2>Using the SGUI library</h2>

<h3>Filesystem abstraction</h3>

It has already been mentioned that SGUI supports filesystem abstraction
(the NULL pointer passed to the <b>sgui_font_load</b> function). What this
means is that SGUI does not access the filesystem directly, instead it uses
a struct of type <b>sgui_filesystem</b>, holding various callbacks.<br>
<br>
With this meachanism you can redirect the SGUI file accesses to your own
functions, so it accesses a compressed archive, a network source, a virtual
filesystem like PhysicsFS or some implementation for a microcontroller where
there is no native filesystem instead of the actual filesystem.<br>
<br>
All you need to do is instantiate the <b>sgui_filesystem</b> structure, fill
it with pointers to functions that open/close/read from/get the size of opaque
file handles. (Consult the doxygen documentation or read the
<b>sgui_filesystem.h</b> header for more details).<br>
<br>
All SGUI functions that access files require a pointer to an
<b>sgui_filesystem</b> structure. If you pass NULL, they simply call
<b>sgui_filesystem_get_default</b> what returns a pointer to an implementation
that uses the STDIO functions.
