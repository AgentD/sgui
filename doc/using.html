<h1>SGUI</h1>

<h2>Using the SGUI library</h2>

Logically, using the library requires to set up your development environment
in a way that the SGUI include directory ("include" sub directory) is part of
the include path and the sgui library gets linked to your program.

The shared library, aka dll, is located under "bin/&lt;platform&gt;/" in the
root directory of the downloaded archive, or in the "build" sub directory if
you compile SGUI yourself.

Under Windows&reg; one must link agains the static library in the
"lib/&lt;platform&gt;/" sub directory.<br>
<br>

The easiest way to make the SGUI declarations visible to your code is by
including "sgui.h", which includes all other SGUI headers:

<br><br><p class="code">
<font class="cpp">#include</font> <font class="string">"sgui.h"</font>
</p><br>

You don't need to worry about overriden headers or namespace polution.
All public SGUI headers start with "sgui_*", all functions and datatypes
with "sgui_*" and all enumerations and constants with "SGUI_".<br>
<br>
Lets start with a minimal example that does nothing but show off initialisation,
shutdown and how to compile the library.

<h3>Initialisation and the main loop</h2>

To start using SGUI, initialisation has to be done first. (Perhaps somewhere
in your main function) and logically, once you are done using SGUI, a proper
unitialisation has to be done, what can be done using the <b>sgui_init</b> and
<b>sgui_deinit</b> functions.<br>
<br>
Between initialisation and shutdown lies a main loop, where window system
messages are handled and the GUI is updated. For this purpose, there is the
<b>sgui_main_loop</b> function which enters an infinite loop in which it
handles events from the window system, updates the SGUI windows (this minimal
example does not create any), call event callbacks and so on. It will not
return until all visible windows are closed. Since we don't have any windows
in this example, it will return immediately.<br>
<br>
Lets take a look at the code:

<br><p class="code">
<font class="cpp">#include</font> <font class="string">"sgui.h"</font><br>
<br>
<font class="keyword">int</font> main( )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_init( );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_main_loop( );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_deinit( );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="keyword">return</font> 0;<br>
}
</p><br>

<br>
Compiling this simple example application with gcc under a UNIX&reg; like
operating system requires the following command:
<p class="code">
<font class="command">gcc</font> -I&lt;sgui_include_path&gt; -Wl,-rpath,. -L&lt;bin_path&gt; -lsgui test.c
</p>

<ul>
<li>With the "-I" option the SGUI include directory is added to the
    compilers include path</li>
<li>The "-Wl,-rpath,." option tells the compiler that the generated
    binary should look for "libsgui.so" in its own directory. This is only
    needed when SGUI is not installed to your systems library directory
    (e.g through the distributions package management system).</li>
<li>The "-L&lt;bin_path&gt;" tells the compiler to look for libraries in the
    SGUI bin directory. Again, this is not needed when SGUI is installed to
    your system.</li>
<li>The option "-lsgui" tells the compiler to link against the SGUI
    library.</li>
</ul>

This command should produce a working "a.out" that does nothing. To run the
program, the "libsgui.so" has to be in the same directory as "a.out".<br>
<br>
Or alternatively, you can link SGUI statically:
<p class="code">
<font class="command">gcc</font> -I&lt;sgui_include_path&gt; -L&lt;lib_path&gt; -lsgui_static test.c
</p>
<br>

For Windows&reg;, the command line for mingw would look like this (where "gcc"
is of course the proper name of your "mingw" binary):
<p class="code">
<font class="command">gcc</font> -I&lt;sgui_include_path&gt; test.c -L&lt;lib_path&gt; -lsgui
</p>
Properly configuring Visual Studio&reg; or any other IDE to link against the SGUI
static library and add the SGUI include path is left as a task for the reader.
