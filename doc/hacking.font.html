<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>Font rasterization</h3>

The backend also has to supply an implementation of the <b>sgui_font</b> data
structure. There are two functions in <b>sgui_font.h</b> that are implemented
directly in the backend. One for loading an abstract font data structure from
a file and one for loading it from memory.<br>
<br>
The implementations in the Windows&reg; and X11 backends use the FreeType
library to rasterize true type fonts, but one could also implement a simple,
static font bitmap.<br>
<br>
The <b>sgui_font</b> abstract data structure supports the
following operations:
<ul>
<li>Resolve a unicode code point to a glyph from the in-memory representation.
<li>Get the dimensions of a previously loaded glyph.
<li>Get a pointer to a buffer containing the previously loaded,
    rasterized glyph.
</ul>
The font data structure is used by a canvas implementations to rasterize text.
However, a canvas might also use an <b>sgui_font_cache</b> that caches glyph
in an <b>sgui_pixmap</b> to minimize glyph loading and rasterizing and instead
blend the already loaded glyphs. The font cache uses an RB-Tree internally to
store loaded glyphs and their area on the cache pixmap. It only loads glyphs
if they cannot be found in the tree.
