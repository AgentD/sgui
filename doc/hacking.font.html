<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>Font rasterization</h3>

The backend also has to supply an implementation of the <b>sgui_font</b> data
structure. The functions from <b>sgui_font.h</b> are implemented directly in
the backend.<br>
<br>
The implementations in the Windows&reg; and X11 backends use the FreeType
library to rasterize true type fonts, but a backend might also implement a
simple, static font bitmap.<br>
<br>
The <b>sgui_font</b> functions support the following operations:
<ul>
<li>Load fonts from a file or from memory.
<li>Get the dimensions of a glyph.
<li>Render a glyph to a memory buffer.
</ul>
Those functions are then used by canvas implementations to rasterize text.
However, a canvas might also use an <b>sgui_font_cache</b> that caches glyph
in an <b>sgui_pixmap</b> to minimize glyph loading and rasterizing and instead
blend the already loaded glyphs. The font cache uses an RB-Tree internally to
store loaded glyphs and theire area on the cache pixmap. It only loads glyphs
if they cannot be found in the tree.
