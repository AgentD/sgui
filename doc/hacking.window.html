<h2>Hacking SGUI</h2>

<h3>The backend window system abstraction</h3>

In the source directory of the core module, there is one subdirectory for each
backend implementation. There is no backend loading, the library is compiled
with exactely one active backend implementation.<br>
<br>
The functions <b>sgui_init</b>, <b>sgui_deinit</b>, <b>sgui_main_loop</b> and
<b>sgui_main_loop_step</b> are implemented directly in the backend. The
currently existing X11 and Windows&reg; backend implement the functions in
a file called <b>platform.c</b>.<br>
<br>
The init and deinit functions have to at least reset the event queue and the
skinning system (<b>sgui_skin_set( NULL )</b>,
<b>sgui_interal_skin_deinit_default( )</b>,
<b>sgui_internal_reset_events( )</b>).<br>
<br>
The platform file typically also implements the functions
<b>sgui_internal_lock_mutex</b> and <b>sgui_internal_unlock_mutex</b> that
lock and unlock the global mutex.<br>
<br>
<h4>The window implementation</h4>
To create a window, the backend provides the function
<b>sgui_window_create_desc</b> that creates a structure derived from
<b>sgui_window</b> with the appropriate super callbacks set. The list of
callbacks can be retrieved from the declaration of the window structure in
the <b>sgui_internal.h</b> header.<br>
<br>
If the backend supports hardware accelerated rendering contexts, the context
creation function from <b>sgui_context.h</b> is implemented directly in the
backend as well, setting the appropriate callbacks for the <b>sgui_context</b>
structure. The different kinds of rendering contexts are enumerated in
<b>sgui_window.h</b>.<br>
<br>
For convenience, the function <b>sgui_internal_window_post_init</b> can be
used at the end of the window creation function to do typcial tasks like
storing the window size and clearing the window canvas.<br>
<br>
When the window receives an event in the backend event processing function,
the event has to be translated to an <b>sgui_event</b> (if possible) and sent
to the <b>sgui_internal_window_fire_event</b> function that takes care of
sending the event to the canvas, adding it to the event queue and tracking
keyboard modifyers.<br>
<br>
As already mentioned, every window has an instance of an <b>sgui_canvas</b>
implementation that manages widgets and supplies 2D rendering functions.<br>
<br>
If a backend doesn't have special drawing functions, it can use the memory
canvas reference implementation that draws to a memory buffer. It can be
created using <b>sgui_memory_canvas_create</b>.<br>
<br>
When creating a new implementation of a backend, it is adviseable to look at
another existing backend implementation for details and hints.
