<h3>SGUI & OpenGL&reg;</h3>

The SGUI library can create windows with OpenGL&reg; contexts, both using the
older 1.x and 2.x versions, as well as using the 3.x and above core profile
versions.<br>
<br>
SGUI can create a window with an OpenGL&reg; context, either entirely managed
with a redraw event sent to the window callback, or the program can take
control over event processing and rendering, to allow for high frame rate real
time rendering.
<br><br>
SGUI also offers an OpenGL&reg; widget, allowing easy creation of dedicated
areas within a window to use for OpenGL&reg; rendering with normal widgets
grouped around it.
<br><br>
OpenGL&reg; windows won't have a canvas object and as such cannot render
widgets.

<h4>Creating a managed OpenGL&reg; window</h4>

The code for a small example program can be found in the file <b>extras/gl0.c</b>.
For the sake of simplicity, compatibillity profile has been used.<br>
<br>
To create a window with an OpenGL&reg; context, the
<b>sgui_window_create_desc</b>
function has to be used instead of the regular sgui_window_create function.
The sgui_window_create_desc function uses a pointer to an
<b>sgui_window_description</b>
structure that can hold advanced parameters.<br>
<br>
In the case of OpenGL&reg; windows, the following fields are of interest
to us:
<ul>
<li><b>backend</b> This field specifies what backend the window should use. To use the plain, normal
    window system, specify <b>SGUI_NATIVE</b>. For OpenGL&reg; rendering, specify either
    <b>SGUI_OPENGL_CORE</b> or <b>SGUI_OPENGL_COMPAT</b>. The former uses a core profile context
    while the later uses compatibillity profile.</li>
<li><b>doublebuffer</b> Set this to a non-zero value (or <b>SGUI_DOUBLEBUFFERED</b>)
    to request a context with a distinct front and back buffer.</li>
<li><b>bits_per_pixel</b> This specifies the number of color bits per pixel (valid values: 16, 24 or 32)</li>
<li><b>depth_bits</b> This specifies the number of depth bits per pixel, 0 means don't create a depth buffer</li>
<li><b>stencil_bits</b> This specifies the number of stencil bits per pixel, 0 means don't create a stencil buffer</li>
<li><b>samples</b> This specifies the number of samples per pixel for multisample anti aliasing, 0 means don't use
    MSAA</li></li>
<li><b>share</b> If given a pointer to an existing window with an OpenGL&reg;
    context, the context of the new window will share resources with it.
</ul>

When creating the window with the description structure pointer, an OpenGL&reg;
context is created automatically. The window behaves like a regular SGUI
window. The are a few differences however:
<ul>
<li>An OpenGL&reg; window cannot have any widgets attached to it</li>
<li>When the window system requests a redraw, an <b>SGUI_EXPOSE_EVENT</b>
    event is generated</li>
<li>After catching the expose event in a window event callback, the window
    has to be made current in order to draw to it</li>
</ul>

Making the rendering context current just requires a call to
<b>sgui_window_make_current</b>. To release the context, call
<b>sgui_window_release_current</b>.<br>
<br>
The window can be used just like every other normal SGUI window, however it
is not suited for interactive OpenGL&reg; rendering demands (i.e. pumping out
frame after frame at interactive frame rates), since the window is only
redrawn when it has to.<br>
<br>
We will address that issue in the next section.

<h4>Creating a manually managed OpenGL&reg; window</h4>

The code for a small example program can be found in the file <b>extras/gl1.c</b>.
For the sake of simplicity, compatibillity profile has been used.<br>
<br>
The window is created in the very same way as in the section above. The major
difference here is, that rendering is done inside a manual main loop instead
of an event function. The rendering context has to be made current before
entering the main loop<br>
<br>
The major difference is the main loop:

<p class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="keyword">while</font>( sgui_main_loop_step( ) )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glClear( <font class="number">GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</font> );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="comment">/* OpenGL rendering commands go here */</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_swap_buffers( wnd );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</p>
Instead of calling the regular sgui_main_loop, the sgui_main_loop_step
function is used. This function just receives <i>one</i> window system
message, processes it, and returns immediately. If there are no messsages, it
returns immediately. The return value is non-zero if there are still visible
windows. After every main loop step, rendering to the window is performed. At
the end of the loop, when rendering is done, the
<b>sgui_window_swap_buffers</b>
function is called to swap the front and the back buffer (in case of double
buffering). This way, rendering at interactive frame rates can be achived.<br>

<h4>Creating an OpenGL&reg; subwindow</h4>

Normally, when an application needs OpenGL&reg; rendering to display
something, but does not neccessarily need interactive rendering, something
like a small display area inside a normal window is desired.<br>
<br>
If you read the doxygen documentation on the <b>sgui_window_description</b>
structure (or read the header), you may have noticed, that the structure has a
<b>parent</b> attribute. Using this attribute, a window (in this case with an
OpenGL&reg; rendering context) can be created that resides undecorated,
untouched by the window manager inside a regular window.<br>
<br>
To make your life easier, SGUI provides you with a nice widget that
encapsulates that in a simple interface and behaves like a normal widget.
<br>
<br>
The widget in question is called
<b>subview widget</b>. It can be
created like a normal widget, attached to a window, or even as a child widget
to another widget, and so on.<br>
<br>
To draw to the widget, a callback can be registered that is called as soon as
the underlying window requires redrawing. Making the context current and
swapping the buffers is taken care off by the widget.<br>
<br>
In addition, a callback can be registered that receives events from the
underlying window (mouse movements, keyboard actions, etc...) and the window
itself can be obtained to do more fancy stuff.<br>
<br>
For instance, it is perfectly possible to set the callback to NULL, obtain a
pointer to the underlying window and call <b>sgui_window_make_current</b> on
the window in a second thread that then draws to the sub window in a loop.

<h4>Loading extension function pointers</h4>

Using the function <b>sgui_window_get_context</b> it is possible to get a
pointer to an OpenGL&reg; context object from a window. This pointer can be
used for loading pointers to extension functions via the
<b>sgui_context_load</b> function that takes as arguments a pointer to a
context object and a name string.

<h4>Creating a dedicated resource loading context</h4>

In some application it is desired to create a dedicated context for resource
loading. That context shares resources with the context used for rendering and
is bound to a different thread, dedicated to loading resources.<br>
<br>
After getting the context object from a window using
<b>sgui_window_get_context</b>, the function <b>sgui_context_create</b> can be
used to create a new context that shares resources with the existing context.
The function <b>sgui_context_destroy</b> can be used to destroy that context
when no longer needed.<br>
<br>
All that is left to do in the loading thread is to make the new context
current with <b>sgui_context_make_current</b>, and later releasing it using
<b>sgui_context_release_current</b>.
