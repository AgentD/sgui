\section intro Introduction

\image html shot1.png

SGUI is a small, simple, cross platform GUI library, written in plain
ANSI C (C89), with the aim to create a simple, easy to use "just-works" GUI
library for small applications and test programs that just need a simple GUI.

Major design goals are simplicity, small code size and correctness
(concerning the standards involved and memory leaks).

Above you can see screenshots of the SGUI test program.

The idea of creating a small GUI library emerged after being unsatisfied
with the existing GUI libraries that tend to be extremely bloated, resource
hungry, complicated and very slow on older systems.

The project originally emerged from an Xlib play pen written out of plain
boredomness in school.

The library offers a range of features:
 - Lightweight
   - Comparatively small size
   - Comparatively small memory footprint
 - Easy to use aplication programming interface
   - Object-oriented desing
   - Written entirely in ANSI C89
 - Cross platform
   - Tested on various GNU/Linux distributions, 32 and 64 bit x86
   - Tested on Mircrosoft Windows(R) 98, XP and 7 (32 bit and 64 bit)
 - Threadsafe
 - Interacts with OS clipboard (copy/cut & paste)
 - Supports keyboard only user interaction
 - Handwritten manual with examples in addition to doxygen reference
 - OpenGL(R) support
    - can create a window with OpenGL(R) context
    - core profile as well as compatibillity profile
    - OpenGL(R) widget for rendering inside a normal GUI application
 - Direct3D(R) support, verions 9 and 11 (feature level 9.0 to 11.0)
 - Addon library can manage and render sub-windows inside OpenGL(R) or
   Direct3D(R) window.
 - Permissive Free Software (aka "Open Source") license
    - X11, aka MIT license (License text added below)
    - Allows you to do whatever you want, as long as credit is given

\section example A simple example

The code below creates a 400*300 pixel window with a text label in it and a
button that closes the window when pressed:

\code
#include "sgui.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main( )
{
    sgui_window* wnd;
    sgui_widget* text;
    sgui_widget* button;

    sgui_init( );

    wnd = sgui_window_create( NULL, 400, 300, SGUI_RESIZEABLE );

    sgui_window_set_title( wnd, "Simple Sample" );
    sgui_window_move_center( wnd );
    sgui_window_set_visible( wnd, SGUI_VISIBLE );

    text = sgui_label_create( 10, 10, "To close the window,\n"
                                      "press <color=\"#FF0000\">close");

    button = sgui_button_create( 30, 60, 75, 30, "Close", 0 );

    sgui_window_add_widget( wnd, text );
    sgui_window_add_widget( wnd, button );

    sgui_event_connect( button, SGUI_BUTTON_OUT_EVENT,
                        sgui_window_set_visible, wnd,
                        SGUI_INT, SGUI_INVISIBLE );

    sgui_main_loop( );

    sgui_window_destroy( wnd );
    sgui_widget_destroy( text );
    sgui_widget_destroy( button );
    sgui_deinit( );

    return 0;
}
\endcode

\section platforms Supported platforms

So far, SGUI has a Windows&reg; and an Xlib back end. The demo application
has been successfully compiled and run under Wine, Windows&reg; 98, XP, 7
(32bit and 64 bit), Ubuntu 32 bit, Arch 64 bit, CentOS 6 32 bit and 64 bit.

The OpenGL&reg; support of the library has been successfully used with
variuous ATI and nVidia cards (proprietary implementation) as well an
integrated Intel GPU (via Mesa and proprietary implementation).
