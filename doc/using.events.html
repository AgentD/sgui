<h2>Using the SGUI library</h2>

<h3>Event callbacks</h3>

To provide user interaction with your program, SGUI provides two types of
callbacks. A <b>window callback</b> and a <b>widget callback</b>. Both types
of callbacks can be registerd to a window, but only <b>one of each kind per
window</b>.<br>
<br>
The window callback gets called whenever something happens to the window
(e.g. the window gets resized, closed, the mouse moves inside the window,
etc...). The widget callback gets called whenever something happens to a
widget (e.g. button pressed, checkbox checked, etc...).<br>
You can read about all kinds of window and widgets events in the doxygen
documentation or the <b>sgui_event.h</b> header.<br>
<br>
Lets extend our previous example by a simple widget callback:
<p class="code">
<font class="keyword">void</font> widget_callback( sgui_widget* widget, <font class="keyword">int</font> type, <font class="keyword">void</font>* user )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="keyword">if</font>( type == SGUI_BUTTON_CLICK_EVENT )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_set_visible( user, SGUI_INVISIBLE );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</p>
We can see that a widget callback receives three arguments. The first is a
pointer to the widget that triggered the event, the second is an integer
identifying what kind of evenet happened and the third is a user pointer that
you can specify when registering the callback. In this example we assume that
the user pointer is a pointer to an sgui_window struct and make it invisible
when an <b>SGUI_BUTTON_CLICK_EVENT</b> happens. Because we only have one
button, we ignore the widget pointer.<br>
<br>
Now lets also make a window callback that simply prints all characters entered
while the window has focus:
<p class="code">
<font class="keyword">void</font> window_callback( sgui_window* wnd, <font class="keyword">int</font> type, sgui_event* event )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="keyword">if</font>( type == SGUI_CHAR_EVENT )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf( <font class="string">"%s\n"</font>, event->char_event.as_utf8_str );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
</p>
The window callback also receives three arguments. The first is a pointer
to the window that triggered the event. The second is an integer identifying
what kind of event happened and the third is a pointer to a union holding
information about the event.<br>
In this example we ignore the window pointer and, whenever an
<b>SGUI_CHAR_EVENT</b> happens, i.e the keyboard keys pressed by the user
could be composed into a printable UTF8 string, we print that string.<br>
<br>
All we need to do now, is to register those callbacks after we create the
window:
<p class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_on_widget_event( wnd, widget_callback, wnd );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_on_event( wnd, window_callback );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</p>
The first function call registers the widget callback, with the first argument
being the window to register to, the second being the callback and the third
the user pointer to pass to the callback, which is our window here.<br>
<br>
The second function call registers our window event callback.<br>
<br>
When you compile the program and run it from the command line you will notice
a few things:
<ul>
<li>You can now close the window and terminate the program by pressing
    the "Close" button.
<li>When pressing keys while the window has focus, they are printed to the
    command line.
<li>You can also compose keys (e.g. letters like '&Acirc;' or '&agrave;' can
    be entered, but don't worry, there is also an event type for simple
    key-pressed, key-released events).
</ul>

<br>

With the things you've read so far and the doxygen documentation, it should be
fairly easy to compose simple GUI applications. But I would like to show you a
few hints on how the event processing callback was originaly intended:
<ul>
<li>Make the widgets of a window accessible to the widget event callback
    (e.g stuff them into a structure and register it as a user pointer).
<li>C++ users might use a class and register a pointer to a class instance as
    user pointer and redirect events to an appropriate method.
<li>Decide what to do based on what event happened and which widget caused it.
<li>The single event callback design has been choses for its simplicity. A
    signals-and-slots like system can be easily built on top of it. (see the
    "extras" subdirectory).
</ul>
