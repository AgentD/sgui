<h2>Using the SGUI library</h2>

<h3>Event callbacks</h3>

The SGUI library provides two mechanisms for receiving events:
<ul>
<li><b>Signals & slots</b> like callback system. The library can be told to
    react to a specific event by calling a function on an object with
    given arguments (even arguments passed on by the event source).
<li><b>Window callbacks</b> can be registered directly to windows to receive
    notifications about window resize events, key press-release events,
    mouse movements, etc... concerning the window that it was registered to.
    Every window can have exactely one callback.
</ul>

Lets take a look at the first option to make our close button actually close
the window.<br>
<br>
The <b>sgui_event_connect</b> function is used to connect an event with a
response. We simply add this before calling sgui_init:

<p class="code">
...<br>
sgui_event_connect( button, SGUI_BUTTON_OUT_EVENT, <font class="number">1</font>, sgui_window_set_visible, wnd, SGUI_INT, SGUI_INVISIBLE );<br>
...<br>
</p>
The first argument is the source of the event. In this case the button widget.
The second argument is the specific event to react to, when triggered by the
given souce. The third argument tells the function that the source object is
a widget (nonzero or <b>TRUE</b> means widget, zero or <b>FALSE</b> means it
is a window).<br>
<br>
What follows is the function to call when reacting to the event, in our case
we want to turn the window invisible, hence sgui_window_set_visible. The
next argument is the object to use the function on, our window.
<b>SGUI_INT</b> specifies, that an additional integer argument should be
passed to the function. The additional integer argument is set to
SGUI_INVISIBLE in order to thide the window.<br>
<br>
And that's it! That is everything required to connect the button click to the
window close action. Or any other event to any other action for that matter.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now lets take a look at window callbacks. In our example, we want to print out
every character entered while our window has focus. The function that does
this, with the signature of <b>sgui_window_callback</b> is given below:

<p class="code">
<font class="keyword">void</font> window_callback( <font class="keyword">void</font>* user, const sgui_event* event )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class="keyword">if</font>( event->type == SGUI_CHAR_EVENT )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf( <font class="string">"%s\n"</font>, event->arg.utf8 );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</p>

All that's left to do now is to register that callback to our window:

<p class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sgui_window_on_event( wnd, window_callback );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</p>

Alternatively, the same thing could also be done this way:

<p class="code">
...<br>
sgui_event_connect( wnd, SGUI_CHAR_EVENT, <font class="number">0</font>, printf, <font class="string">"%s\n"</font>, SGUI_FROM_EVENT, SGUI_UTF8 );<br>
...<br>
</p>
