<h1>SGUI</h1>

<h2>Advanced usage</h2>

<h3>SGUI & Direct3D&reg;</h3>

Similar to <a href="adv.opengl.html">OpenGL&reg;</a>, the SGUI library can
create windows with a Direct3D&reg; device/context. The Windows&reg; backend
directly supports Direct3D&reg; 9 and 11 (feature level 9.0 to 11.1). Because
Direct3D&reg; requires access to a lot of data structures created with the
context, the declarations of the underlying context structures are exposed via
the headers <b>sgui_d3d9.h</b> and <b>sgui_d3d11.h</b> that have to be
included in the application as no other public header includes them.<br>
<br>
The library itself does <i>not link against any Direct3D&reg; library</i> and
can be used on older versions of Windows&reg; whtere the required DLLs are not
available without recompilation. The SGUI Windows&reg; backend internally
tries to load the libraries at runtime when requested. Since all D3D objects
are created from the objects in the sgui_context, an application using SGUI
also doesn't have to link agains Direct3D&reg; libraries.<br>
<br>
Samples on how all of this is done are provided in the <i>extras/</i>
directory and pointed out below.<br>
<br>
Similar to <a href="adv.opengl.html">OpenGL&reg;</a>, the subview widget
can also create a sub window with a Direct3D&reg 9 or 11 device/context.<br>
<br>
It is adviceable to also look at the <a href="adv.opengl.html">OpenGL&reg;</a>
section for comparison as they share a lot of concepts and API calls. Because
legacy GL requires a lower setup overhead to get a triangle drawn, the
OpenGL&reg; samples are also less cluttered, shorter and simpler.<br>
<br>

<h4>Creating a managed Direct3D&reg; window</h4>

The code for a small example program can be found in the files
<b>extras/d3d9_0.c</b> for Direct3D&reg; 9 and <b>extras/d3d11_0.c</b> for
Direct3D&reg; 11. The programs work in ways similar to <b>extras/gl0.c</b>
but use Direct3D&reg; 9 and 11 respectively. The symbolic constants
<b>SGUI_DIRECT3D_9</b> and <b>SGUI_DIRECT3D_11</b> are used to request the
API versions from the backend.<br>
<br>
The sample programs create a Direct3D&reg; window, along with resources
required to draw a triangle. The <i>EXPOSE</i> event generated by the window
when it is asked by the OS to redraw itself is connected to a callback that
renderes the actual frame.<br>
<br>
The function <b>sgui_window_swap_buffers</b> is used in both samples. The D3D9
implementation calls <i>Present</i> on the device, the D3D11 implementation
calls <i>Present</i> on the swapchain.<br>
<br>

<h4>Creating a manually managed Direct3D&reg; window</h4>

The code for small smple programs can be found in the files
<b>extras/d3d9_1.c</b> and <b>extras/d3d11_1.c</b> which work in ways similar
to <b>extras/gl1.c</b>, except for using D3D9 and D3D11 respectively.<br>
<br>
After creating a window and the neccessary resources to draw a triangle, the
sample programs enter a manual main loop using <b>sgui_main_loop_step</b> to
fetch and process window system messages (if any) at every iteration. Drawing
is done directly in the loop body at maximum framerate.<br>
<br>

<h4>Creating a Direct3D&reg; subwindow</h4>

It is also possible to create a subwindow with a Direct3D&reg; device/context
as a small drawing area inside of a window containing normal widgets. Such a
sub window can be easily handled like a normal widget by using the
<b>sgui_subview</b> widget. An OpenGL&reg; example on how to use the subview
widget can be found in <b>extras/gl2.c</b>.<br>
<br>
A subview widget can use either a redrawing callback, similar to the
<b>extras/d3d*_0.c</b> programs, or a dedicated drawing thread can be created
that grabs the device/context of the underlying window and continuously
redraws the scene in a loop.

<br>
<br>

<h4>Getting the internals</h4>

A pointer to the underlying <b>sgui_context</b> object of a window is obtained
by calling <b>sgui_window_get_context</b> on the window pointer. The context
pointer returned can then be casted to either <b>sgui_d3d9_context</b>
(which can be found in <b>sgui_d3d9.h</b>) or <b>sgui_d3d11_context</b>
(which can be found in <b>sgui_d3d11.h</b>).<br>
<br>
The D3D9 structure contains a pointer to an <i>IDirect3DDevice9</i> and the
<i>D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS</i> struct.<br>
<br>
The D3D11 structure contains a pointers to the <i>IDXGISwapChain</i>, the
<i>ID3D11Device</i>, the <i>ID3D11DeviceContext</i>, as well as to the
backbuffer view (<i>ID3D11RenderTargetView</i>), if requested at window
creation the depth/stencil texture (<i>ID3D11Texture2D</i>) and view
(<i>ID3D11DepthStencilView</i>). The later two are NULL if not requested
during window creation.<br>

<br>
<br>

<h4>Window resizing, present parameter changes and lost devices</h4>

Changing the size of a window or vsync settings under Direct3D&reg; 9 requires
a <i>device reset</i> which will cause the application to lose all GPU
buffers. Similarly, a D3D9 device can enter a <i>LOST</i> state under certain
conditions which also requires a device reset.<br>
<br>
Before calling the Reset method on the device, however, all un-managed
resources have to be released. Since the SGUI library has no knowledge of any
resources created by the device, it only updates the present parameters, but
leaves the task of resetting the device to the user.<br>
<br>
At the end of the message processing function, the devices of all
Direct3D&reg; 9 windows are checked for their "cooperative level". If a device
entered a lost state, an <b>SGUI_D3D9_DEVICE_LOST</b> event is generated.<br>
<br>
Since Direct3D&reg; 11 has a way saner API, SGUI can fully manage
window resizes and other parameter changes. When the window size changes
(either by calling the resize function or by the user dragging the window
edges around), the swapchain back buffer is resized, along with the
depth/stencil texture created for the main frame buffer. The frame buffer and
depth/stencil view objects are also recreated. If the main frame buffer was
bound before resizing, it is rebound after resizing and the viewport
dimensions set to the entire window size.<br>
<br>
In order for any of this to work, the backend must be able to destroy the
buffers with a single Release call, i.e. you <i>must not</i> do anything that
increases the reference count of those objects.
