\section style Coding Style

At the moment, there is no indent file. Altough it should not be too hard to
mimic the style of the code already there, here are a few guidelines:
 - Braces always on the next line, same indentation as the keyword.
 - Lines no longer than 80 columns.
 - Use spaces (4 of them) for indentation.
 - No space between a function name or keyword and the opening paranthesis.
 - No space between a closing paranthesis and a semicolon.
 - Optionally use space before and after first and last function arguments or
   around operators.
 - When wrapping a function call or declaration, the first argument in the
   next line is indented to the same column as the first argument.
 - When wrapping expressions, the operator is always at the end of the line,
   never at the beginning of the new line.
 - All structures are typedefed with a forward declaration in
   \ref sgui_predef.h
 - No typedefs to atomic data types are used. Always use the integer
   data types provided by C (i.e. unsigned int and int).
 - Never make function arguments or struct members enum types for the sake
   of ABI stability.
 - Avoid floating point calculations and data types.
 - Use C++ guards in headers.
 - Use the \b sgui_ prefix for functions and typedefs in headers.
 - Use the \b SGUI_ prefix for enums or preprocessor definitions.
 - Use the \b sgui_ prefix for publicly visible headers.
 - Functions not declared in any headers have to be static.
 - Every header without platform dependencies has to be included
   in \ref sgui.h
