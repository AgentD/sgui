<h2>Using the SGUI library</h2>

<h3>Different types of widgets available</h3>

This page is supposed to give a short overview over the different kinds of
widgets available under SGUI.

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/button.png"></td>
<td>A simple push <b>button</b> that generates an event when clicked and
    released (<b>SGUI_BUTTON_OUT_EVENT</b>). Can also be configured to act as
    a toggle button to stay in a state (either in or out) and generat events
    on state change (<b>SGUI_BUTTON_IN_EVENT</b>,
    <b>SGUI_BUTTON_OUT_EVENT</b>). Toggle buttons can be grouped together like
    radio buttons, where exactely one button can be selected at a time.</td>
    When the selection in a group changes, the one that gets selected triggers
    an <b>SGUI_BUTTON_IN_EVENT</b> event. Buttons are not restricted to text
    but can also display icons inside them.
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/check.png"></td>
<td><b>Checkboxes</b> as we know them. Generates an event when checked or
    unchecked (<b>SGUI_BUTTON_IN_EVENT</b>, <b>SGUI_BUTTON_OUT_EVENT</b>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/group.png"></td>
<td>A <b>radio button</b> looks like a checkbox, but with a circular area to
    the left. Several radio buttons can be connected to a group. In a group of
    radio buttons, only one at a time can be selected. When the selection in a
    group changes, the one that gets selected triggers an
    <b>SGUI_BUTTON_IN_EVENT</b> event. 
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/edit.png"></td>
<td>A box that text can be entered into. Text can be selected and
    copied/pasted via the systems clipboard. An <b>edit box</b> can optionally
    only allow numeric input, or not show the entered text (password)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/iconview.png"></td>
<td>An <b>icon view</b> can display an assortments of icons with text
    underneath them. Icons can be clicked and draged around inside the view
    area. An <b>SGUI_ICON_SELECTED</b> event is generated when a selected
    icon gets double clicked or the return key is pressed. Similar events
    are generated when a delete/copy/cut key combination is sent to an
    icon.</td>
</tr>
<td><img src="images/progress.png"></td>
<td>This is a <b>progress bar</b>. It indicates progress. As you can see,
    there are different styles (continuous and stippled). Vertical progress
    bars, that are filled from bottom to top, also exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/static.png"></td>
<td><b>Static image</b>s and <b>static text</b> for displaying purposes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/glwidget.png"></td>
<td>The black rectangle with a triangle inside is a <b>subview</b> widget.
    It manages a sub window. In this case, the sub window has an OpenGL&reg;
    context bound to it and is redrawn by a callback.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/frame.png"></td>
<td>The outermost rectangle is a <b>frame</b> widget. It simply displays
    widgets in an inset box. Children can be attached with
    sgui_widget_add_child and the frame will automatically display scroll bars
    when it overflows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/group.png"></td>
<td>This is a <b>group box</b> widget. It just draws a fancy border with a
    caption around its children to visually seperate and functionally group
    other widgets. Children can be added with sgui_widget_add_child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/tab.png"></td>
<td>This image show the captions of a <b>tab group</b> widget. Children are
    arranged in tabs. The function sgui_tab_group_add_widget is used to add
    widgets to specific tabs.</td>
</tr>
