  What is this?
  *************

  This (sgui) is a miniature cross platform GUI library that originally
  started out as an overgrown Xlib play pen.

  The whole library is written in plain ANSI C (C89) with minimalistic,
  simple, lightweight desing in mind.

  The main motivation was to write a simple, small GUI systems for small
  aplications that need a simple, "just works" GUI, after being unsatisfied
  with existing GUI solutions that are incredibly huge, bloated, resource
  hogging monsters that tend to be hard to use, if not even forcing a specific
  structure to your code and requiring a custom pre-preprocessor (you know the
  one I mean^^). It should be simple, small and easy to use.

  The 's' in "sgui" was intended to mean "small" and "simple", but over time,
  lots of other possible meanings for the letter 's' came to my mind, so the
  's' stands for whatever you want it to.


  The sgui library offers a range of features:
    - Lightweight
        - Comparatively small size
        - Comparatively small memory footprint
    - Easy to use aplication programming interface
        - Object-oriented desing
        - Written entirely in ANSI C89
    - Cross platform
        - Tested on various GNU/Linux distributions, 32 and 64 bit x86
        - Tested on Mircrosoft Windows(R) 98 and 7 (32 bit and 64 bit)
    - Optional OpenGL(R) support
        - Supports older and newer versions
        - core profile as well as compatibillity profile
        - OpenGL(R) widget for rendering inside a normal GUI application
        - can create a window with OpenGL(R) context
    - Permissive Free Software (aka "Open Source") license
        - X11, aka MIT license (License text added below)
        - Allows you to do whatever you want, as long as credit is given


  What's the status?
  ******************

  The library core (OS abstraction, backend implementation, fundementals) with
  the features as stated above is currently nearing its completion.

  Some basic widgets have been implemented.

  The functionallity offered by library in its current state mostly works, but
  it is by no means ready for production use as is.

  If you have any comments, suggestions, complaints, patches, cookies or
  whatever, I would be glad to hearing from you.
